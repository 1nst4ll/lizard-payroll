```

**Key Architectural Decisions:**
1. **Service Layer Separation:** Clean business logic isolation enables testing and maintenance
2. **Repository Pattern:** Data access abstraction supports future database changes
3. **Policy-Based Authorization:** Fine-grained access control with audit capabilities
4. **Event-Driven Architecture:** Audit logging and notification systems

### üß† Time Processing Intelligence

#### Three-Stage Processing Pipeline
The most sophisticated aspect of the system is the intelligent time processing:

**Stage 1: Preprocessing (Rule-Based Corrections)**
- Handles obvious data anomalies automatically
- Overnight shift detection and protection
- Duplicate and conflicting punch resolution
- Business hours validation

**Stage 2: Smart Interpretation (Pattern Recognition)**
- Employee-specific behavior pattern analysis
- Confidence scoring for ambiguous situations
- Historical data learning for improved accuracy
- Fallback to manual review for low-confidence interpretations

**Stage 3: Final Processing (Business Logic Application)**
- Work pair generation with break deductions
- Holiday pay detection and calculation
- Overtime threshold application (44-hour TC law)
- Final validation and error checking

This approach demonstrates enterprise-level sophistication rarely seen in restaurant management systems.

### üí∞ Financial Calculation Precision

#### Decimal Mathematics Implementation
Critical insight: The system correctly identifies the need for exact decimal arithmetic:

```php
use Decimal\Decimal;

// Prevents floating-point errors in financial calculations
$regularPay = (new Decimal($hours))->mul(new Decimal($rate));
$overtimePay = (new Decimal($overtimeHours))
    ->mul(new Decimal($rate))
    ->mul(new Decimal($overtimeMultiplier));
```

**Why This Matters:**
- Financial calculations must be legally exact
- Floating-point arithmetic can cause rounding errors
- Audit trails require reproducible calculations
- Government reporting demands precision

## Business Domain Analysis

### üè™ Restaurant Industry Sophistication

#### Unique Business Rules Complexity
The system handles restaurant-specific challenges that generic payroll systems cannot:

**Tip Distribution Algorithm:**
```
Total Sales (POS) 
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Less: Credit Card Processing (4%)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Plus: Service Surcharge (30%)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Less: Staff Food Deduction ($300)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Equals: Final Tip Pool
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ BOH Allocation (20%)
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ FOH Allocation (80%)
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Individual Distribution (by hours worked)
```

**Time Clock Complexity:**
- Multiple punch types (IN/OUT) with interpretation needs
- Overnight shifts crossing midnight boundaries
- Break time deductions and calculations
- Holiday work detection with 2x pay multipliers

#### Turks & Caicos Regulatory Environment
**Government Compliance Requirements:**
- **NIB (National Insurance Board):** 5.5% employer + 6.5% employee contributions
- **NHIP (National Health Insurance Plan):** 3% employer + 3% employee contributions
- **Overtime Law:** 44-hour weekly threshold (unique to TC)
- **Holiday Calendar:** 12 official holidays with mandatory 2x pay

**Multi-Bank Environment:**
- FCIB: ACH format with specific field requirements
- Scotiabank: CSV format with bank-specific validation
- RBC: Fixed-width format with checksum requirements

### üéØ User Experience Challenges

#### Multi-Stakeholder Requirements
The system must serve distinctly different user types:

**Restaurant Management (Primary Users):**
- Non-technical staff requiring intuitive interfaces
- Time-pressured environment demanding efficiency
- Need for override capabilities and manual adjustments
- Responsibility for compliance and accuracy

**Employees (Secondary Users):**
- Limited technical skills
- Mobile-first access needs
- Transparency requirements for pay calculations
- Self-service capabilities for pay stubs and history

**Accountant/Bookkeeper (Tertiary Users):**
- Integration requirements with existing systems
- Detailed financial reporting needs
- Audit trail and compliance documentation
- Export capabilities for tax preparation
